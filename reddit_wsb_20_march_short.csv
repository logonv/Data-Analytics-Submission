Now SEC is investigating, brokers are disallowing buying more calls. This is the institutions flat out admitting they will change the rules to bail out the rich but if it happens to us, we get a “well shucks you should have known investing is risky! have you tried cutting out avocados and coffee, maybe doing Uber on the side?”

We may have collectively driven up enough sentiment in wall street to make other big players go long on GME with us (we do not have the money to move the stock as much as it did alone). we didn’t hurt wall street as a whole, just a few funds went down while others went up and profited off the shorts the same as us. The media wants to pin the blame on us.

It should be crystal clear that this is a rigged game by now. Its time to build new exchanges that can’t arbitrarily change the rules on us. Cr\*\*o has some version of these, maybe they can be repurposed to be trade stock without government intervention. I don’t know exactly what it will look like yet, but the broad next steps i see are - 1. exit the current financial system 2. build a new one.",2021-01-28 21:30:35

My mother always told me that when I would complain about arbitrary treatment. I would play by the rules and someone else would ignore them. When they would win I would appeal to the first authority for an explanation. ""Are you going to let them get away with this""? ""Life isn't fair"". No, it is not. The game is the game. Always.

In this moment, the fascade cracks further. When the first breach was made I do not know, perhaps it was Socrates, but today I see thousands. Millions. 

Once they were laughing, luxuries falling out of their disgusting diseased mouths as they cackled. The unmistakable stench of derision carried on their breath. They told anyone outside of their elite class that we were fools for even trying. They told us that we were naive. We needed networks to be successful. We needed polish. We needed expertise. We needed THEM. The game is the game. Always. 

They are no longer laughing. Their odious oeuvre still wafts through the air. While the rot, and hate, and condescention, remains, the noxious air betrays a new addition. Something all together disconcerting. What it betrays, is fear. They are afraid. And they should be. We do not need their inherited resources masked as acumen. A new day dawns. The day where we make an ever so slight step towards what they fear the most. An even field. Life becoming ever so slighty more fair.   AND. THEY. ARE. SCARED. They look at us and see roughness. We look at them and see softness. We are both correct in our estimation.

The game is the game. Always.

Fuck them in the street. Fuck them all in the street. We are the righteous. We are blessed by Phoebe. What started here will echo through time in the eons to come. Mount up and ride with the fury of a thousand rockets into the universal filament. May the wind always be at your back and the sun upon your face.

 I really think right now we have enough support and enough of us to change that direction in history. Wallstreet says  well weak companies need to just go. 10 yrs down the road though I want to be able to watch a movie in a movie theater with my family. If we all buy and hold in what we believe in it gives these companies a second chance and we as a group can stop these companies from being shorted to death and just disappear.

And when you're done with GME, it's time to punish the big banks who have been suppressing the price of silver since the Bear Stearns / JPM merge. It's all in fucking Bloomberg:

You think GME squeezed hard? Look what happened to silver half a year ago in July:

&#x200B;

That's one of the banks getting squeezed out of silver, having to cover their shorts... and that's just because rich boomers freaked out about financial instability and finally started calling out the Comex on their bullshit, and taking physically delivery of silver... which they don't have.

Now imagine 4 million degenerates buying $SLV, forcing the trust to take delivery of physical silver from the Comex. This isn't GME, who's fair price is maybe around $5 a share. The FAIR price of silver based on the historical gold/silver ratio is almost surely over $50/ounce. This short squeeze will be a fantastic success even if we can take silver to it's fair market value.

And then there's $AG. Because once silver starts moving, $AG is going to go to the fucking moon. 1) it's a leverage play on silver, 2) It's got it's OWN SHORTS TO BE SQUEEZED OUT. At least a 23% short float as of last count: [https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AG.htm](https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AG.htm)

Paper hands should be ashamed to succumbing to the pressure from dementor hedge funds.

I would also like to preface this post with the fact that this is not a war on billionaires, the wealthy yada yada, but it may well be described as a resistance against injustice, inequiality, poverty, rigged rules, uneven playing field etc which has been rampant on Wall Street forever.

Billionaires are not baddies, at least not all of them. It's what they decide to do with their wealth that is the problem. Using one's wealth perpetuate inequality and injustice is not cool. If all hedge funds were dismantled tomorrow, there will be absolutely no negative consequences to society or social fabric. Hedge funds are not the greatest capital allocators. In fact they are shit at it and the last couple of weeks have proven it.

Sending lots of love to the following billionaires / millionaires: Elon, Chamath, Ryan Cohen, even Warren Buffet and Dr Michael Burry

Fuck you's: Gabe Plotkin (Melvin Capital), Steve Cohen (Point72), Leon Shaulov and Rob Crespi (Maplelane Capital), Ken Griffin (Citadel)

\------------------------------------------------

Now to the main part. What you fellow degenerates, smooth-brains and soft-heads have discovered is called a 'market inefficiency' and are correcting it. The market is acting exactly like it's intended to act. **You are not the problem, you are actually the solution.**

***Why fundamentals don't matter?***

Fundamentals stopped mattering the moment $GME's short interest breached 100% of the available float. See, markets should work as a two way function (you should be able to derive x from y and y from x). There is no possibility at all to buy more than 100% of the available float at any point in time, so why would it be possible to short more than 100% of the float? Why would the market allow such an asymmetric property? Well it shouldn't and the market would and is correcting that.

***So what does matter?***

What really matters now is first principles. Yes, exactly like Papa Elon resumes most of his thought processes as far away from foolish abstractions (read 'fundamentals') down to first principles, this is exactly the same thing what the market is doing right now.

The fools at CNBC (fuck you Wapner - hope you are reading this), CNN, Boomerberg have described the price as being irrational, devoid of logic and reason. So let's break this down for them starting from first principles, Economics 101.

Supply and demand form the most crucial concepts of economics. Whether you are an academic, farmer, banker, hedge fund loser, smooth-brain redditor or a CNBC reporter, the basic premise of supply and demand equilibrium is integrated into your daily actions. Only after understanding the basics of this can the more complicated aspects be mastered.

So let's look at the demand and supply of $GME shares

Demand side:

* Bullish investors - it is no secret that a lot of the investors have taken a position after the narrative around $GME's business model and future prospects are significantly more optimistic with Ryan Cohen now in the driving seat. Now that brankruptcy is out of the question, it is for each investor to decide what the fair value for the stock is. I will leave this part to each one of you individually, as I am just a degenerate smooth-brain redditor that doesn't know shit.
* MMs (no, not market manipulators, just market makers) - these guys sold a ton of short-dated call options to you and haven't learned a shit from what happened last Friday. They are going exactly the same path this friday. There are now around 300k of OI that are ITM (probably more by end of today), which translates into 30M shares that need to be found to the option holders by EOD tomorrow.
* SS (no not the nazi troops, jsut the short sellers) - yeah, you know exactly what's going on here, since this is the essence of the story. Short sellers borrowed around 70M shares and must get them at any price.

Supply side:

* Float - these are the shares that are openly traded and exchange hands every day. Around 51M shares (probably less since you all have diamond hands)
* Share issuance - the company can decide to issue new shares. I believe $GME shelf issuance ammount is around $100M. At yesterday's share price of $347, that's only 0.3M shares. But let's round up to 1M

So what do we get:

Demand = 30M from MMs + 70M from SSs + 10M from bullish investors (this number is out of thin air, I have no clue what it should be). **Total demand: 110M**

Supply = 51M from float + 1M from share issuance. **Total supply: 52M**

Demand / Supply ratio: 2.1x

I will let CNBC, Boomerberg, CNN find another security, commodity, bond or whatever that has that demand / supply ratio and then make judgement on the price for $GME shares.

Finally, *the invisible hand* is a metaphor introduced by the 18th-century Scottish philosopher and economist Adam Smith, characterizes the unseen forces that move the free market economy. It is that very invisible hand that came back to slap the shit out of the 'masters of the universe' hedge funds that decided to ignore the most basic principles of economics.

If any of the hedge fund dementors read this, note that the free market will always, always humble you and put you back where you belong. Fuck you!

Now, I'm fine with closing the position and rolling it out to next week and a higher strike, since I also have a ton of shares. But this still sounds fishy to me, like they wanted to minimize the amount of shares they'd have to buy to hedge for another gamma squeeze. They told me I ""also had other positions that were heavily covered in the media, but those were fine, GME realls is a big exception right now""

I told him that there are apparently enough hedge funds with no risk management either, and that we wouldn't be in this situation otherwise. But he didn't seem like he wanted to hear that.",2021-01-28 20:18:32

In 2008 I was in the middle of my first enlistment.  My college had been taken care of beforehand, because I'd been accepted into a program at UMass Boston for high school students with above-average grades.  A week after graduating high school I received a degree in psychology and went off to be a Marine.

I remember 2008.  I remember my father's savings being nuked, his portfolio going to zero.  Twenty years in the United States Navy and he'd had his savings completely obliterated because of the collapse that Wall Street caused.  I remember my mother calling me in the middle of the night--I was in Okinawa, Japan at the time--and crying because the savings were gone.  That day I started sending a measly $1,000 a month to my family to take care of bills and keep my siblings fed.  My grandmother's retirement was gone in the blink of an eye but she survived, because she loved her job (she was still working in her 60s at a retirement home).  But she had to get a reverse mortgage to keep the house.  I didn't have to send money too long--only about five months--until my father got a better job, and my mother was able to get her own job as well.  But I remember the desperation in her voice.

I'm 34 now.  I've done my time in the military.  No pension, I didn't serve long enough.  But now I can look at this entire debacle and fucking laugh.  I'm a capitalist at heart.  I support being paid for your services.  But I remember the bullshit you engaged in, and I know many others do as well.  Occupy Wall Street did fuck all to you.  But now the internet has given way to arguably the worst thing for you: actual communication and planning.  Now you're seeing what a group of people who loathe everything you stand for can do to you in days.  You won't learn from it, though, which is okay.  This may not keep happening, but every time you decide to attempt something like this the fear will be there, in the back of your mind.  I wish I could have gotten in on this.  I'm not able to spend money like many of these people can.  But I hope it hurts, and it seems like it is.

And there should be no mercy in a situation like this.  Hound them until they concede.  And always remember the motto of the Marine Corps, ""Semper fidelis""--Always Faithful.",2021-01-28 20:16:28

&#x200B;

As you're all aware, Point72(along with citadel) injected \~2.7B into Melvin.  The reason why I bring this up is because Point72's owner, Steven Cohen formerly ran SAC capital. Point72 is a family office, SAC was a hf. Cohen and friends got into shit for insider trading along with paying off research firms to get access to information before anyone else to be the first to profit. They engaged in frequent insider trading which they referred to as black edge and emailed trade ideas with a scale of conviction to show their confidence in the trade. By emailing their trade ideas with a conviction rating and not specifying their source protected Cohen from getting in trouble.  

At the end of all of this, some traders pleaded guilty but Martoma(who served jail time) was Cohen's super bitch because he didn't want Cohen to get caught. Cohen closed SAC and made point72 which happens to be performing outstanding well. He paid a $1.8B penalty. Digging a bit [deeper](https://files.adviserinfo.sec.gov/IAPD/content/viewform/adv102012/Sections/iapd_AdvDrpSection.aspx?ORG_PK=161111&FLNG_PK=02571B2200080189034C92F10037612D056C8CC0), you can see that Cohen has been using material non-public information since 1999. That report shows what they have been caught doing. Imagine all the shit that they got away with. 

Hedge funds have always been doing shady shit and when they get caught, some of them just change their names. Ex. Och-Zif --> Sculptor capital management.

“In the interest of mitigating risk for our company and clients, we have  put in place several restrictions on some transactions in $GME, $AMC,  and other securities,” a spokeswoman for TD Ameritrade told MarketWatch,  referring to the ticker symbols of the companies. “We made these  decisions out of an abundance of caution amid unprecedented market  conditions and other factors.”

It is unclear to me at this point what ""some transactions"" means. Large transactions? Derivates on the stock? Buy orders in general?

If what is written in this article is true, the ""technical difficulties"" that some brokerages were stating yesterday evening are questionable. Maybe someone should read the terms of agreement of TD their TD Ameritrade account and comment if they are allowed to do this. Maybe some SEC rule aplies instead, I am not familiar with this yet.

A Question for today when markets are open:

\- Who is experiencing trading restrictions?

And for the whole community?

\- Are there alternatives?

So shorting well more of stock float, maybe even naked if done so, is ok for institutions, but buying a lot of stock in a collective is not ok. All of this while brokers usually make a lot of money from retail investors trading risky options / derivates, which also result in individuals losing it all.

TL;DR - If robinhood didn't change the rules to spread out the sales of all your ITM contracts you fuckers can't afford to exercise, they would have sold them all at 3;00pm Friday. The market makers would be the only buyers, they sell the shares they were holding to hedge the contracts they sold, they sell all of them at once, large push down then paper hands then stop losses and flash crash.

**BONUS MATERIAL AT THE BOTTOM OF POST.**

\------- now to the real shit.

First off, not a bear or bull, I have GME and will add later yadda yadda. I'm just pointing out an observation.

Second off, this is just a theory. No fucking way I know if this is true. It's gonna sound scary, sure, but I want some genius fucker hedge manager who is pro-GME to tell me how horribly wrong I am.

Robinhood changed the rules and you can't buy any 1DTE or 0DTE positions on GME for 1/29. Ya'll got the memo. That sucks because we ALL know you guys were going to hold on to your positions for EVERY LAST OUNCE OF ROCKET FUEL. (I don't do emojis, sorry.) Robinhood may have just saved you by not letting you.

Most of you fuckers who have options have 100c, 150c, 200c whatever. You know you need money to exercise that - at a cost of $20,000 to exercise for one contract is a little more than most can handle, especially the newbies here.

Under normal circumstances, robinhood would sell your position on Friday back to market at about 3:00pm give or take 5 minutes. The problem is that I've seen the order sheets... It's you lot that owns most of the 1/29 call positions (tiny order sizes... 1 to 5 contracts.) That means most of you won't be able to exercise your position and that means it has to go to market ALL AT ONCE. (Again, this is under normal circumstances.)

What happens when you sell a bunch of contracts at bid to the market? The bid goes down, quite possibly below intrinsic value, the market makers buy it, especially in the last hour of the day, and they do the opposite of what they did last week.

They sell shares against the lower delta. If they are the ones that buy their own contracts back especially if below intrinsic, they sell however many shares the delta was for that contract. They don't want to hold on to those shares if they don't have to. That's not their game.

But they're not just selling for the 350c that's ITM while the underlying is $360. They're selling for the 220c they got at the same time. The 200c they also got. They don't need those covered anymore. So they sell on those as well. The more they sell, the more contracts start becoming OTM and the more they can sell against the lower delta those just became.

If you flush the market with contracts where there is essentially only one buyer - MMs - this kind of thing can happen and you can end up with a potential gamma flush. Opposite of a squeeze. Queue in paper hands and stop losses and you have a very nasty flash crash.

In essence, if Robinhood does NOT do the 3:00pm flush of contracts and instead actually spreads the sales out over the next 2 days, then they saved what could have been a potential flash crash wiping everyone out.

Good luck out there, be safe, make some fucking money, and imagine there are some damn rocket emoji everywhere.

Dillard's is currently sitting at a short percent of float of 146.36% and will be substantially higher after todays price action.

https://www.gurufocus.com/term/FloatPercentageOfTSO/DDS/Float-Percentage-Of-Total-Shares-Outstanding/Dillard

Dillard's $DDS share float is only 4.24 million or 19.26%. What this means is every dollar thrown at Dillard's will affect its price 5x more then a stock with a 100% outstanding float.

The lower the float the easier it is to moon.

Look at this mornings price action. DDS ran 20% to $128 on 240k of volume before being halted and shorted back down. If this stock gets any attention it will run faster than my dad from his parental duties.

Look at the after hours activity. It ran from $82-$93 on 400 shares. That's the type of moon possibility we are dealing with. Any volume premarket can send this up 50%+.

The Total Short Value Could be Underreported - Fines for Underreporting are a fucking joke,750,l6s675,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6s675/the_total_short_value_could_be_underreported/,88,1611852884.0,"During my research on short interest and stats on short history (for my previous TA I did on GME and posted) I came across a release from FINRA. 

In 2015 FINRA fined Morgan Stanley $2M for under reporting their short interest. 

Let’s say that again - fined $2m 

If a fund is a few billion dollars deep in a short - their underreporting of short interest is way more fucking beneficial than paying $2m

This system is fucking rigged and needs to be taken down. 

The regulators are basically saying, “You can destroy companies and fuck over retail all you want. But you gotta pay $2M first.”

We must fight against censorship. WSB is showing how censorship can effect us all if we don't reject it.,629,l6s2vf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6s2vf/we_must_fight_against_censorship_wsb_is_showing/,97,1611852510.0,"There is a desperate and coordinated effort to thwart everything retail investors are doing, censor and ban their communication platforms, and lobby for regulations to protect the elite Wall Street investors against the retail investors.  

CNBC has been relentlessly spreading the narrative that the government needs to step in to 'protect' the retail investors from themselves.  As short-selling hedge funds are bleeding billions of dollars, CNBC has the gaul to suggest that it is the retail investors that need to be protected.  

These ultra-wealthy investors have more influence than you could ever imagine, and they are transparently using it to their advantage.  Not only are they using the media to spread fear about these squeezed stocks to drive the price down and push the narrative that the government needs to regulate retail investors, they are also using their power to CENSOR these communities and keep them from exercising their free speech.  

Tech companies, likely influenced by their politician buddies in Washington, have been overtly censoring millions of people from their platforms simply for having political beliefs that they do not support.  Youtube has been banning channels for minor grievances.  Twitter has been silencing thousands of vocal users.  Facebook has been doing the same.  And most recently, the tech companies used their collective monopolistic power to basically destroy Twitters largest potential competitor: Parler.  It was no coincidence that nearly every tech platform and web service decided within a few hours to ban services to Parler.  They all used the same justification, even though their own platforms were equally as guilty, if not moreso, of the same wrongdoings.  It was blatantly coordinated censorship.  And they don't care, because they have the power.  

Droves of people defended these actions as acceptable because these are not government entities, and they can censor anyone they want.  Many smugly pointed out that this censorship is not a violation of the First Amendment.  And they are legally correct (barring any future antitrust legislation), but they are absolutely morally wrong to defend this censorship.  

Free speech is not just a right enshrined by our constitution, it is a cultural ethos and value that has been embraced by all political sides of this country since this country was founded.  Censoring legal speech has been looked down upon and shunned by nearly everyone in this country for 100's of years.  But recently, it seems that this ethos has been set aside as long as it is only those you disagree with who are being censored.  

And then we have WSB and GME.  

The people of WSB rarely if ever talk politics.  We are a massive group of investors who get together to discuss their dumb investment strategies.  People from every background come together and discuss one thing: investing and tendies.  There is no left or right, no red or blue.....only green.  

But now that they are hitting the elites where it hurts, the wallet, the elite are using their power to censor.  

First, we have Discord.  Over 250,000 people on the WSB discord.  [And it was censored for 'hate speech'.](https://gizmodo.com/discord-bans-r-wallstreetbets-for-hate-speech-violation-1846146314)  The most obvious color to paint a group that you want to silence: call them hateful, racist, etc.  

Note that Discord has had significant investment from private equity funds including FirstMark Capital, Greenoaks Capital Partners, Index Ventures, IVP, Greylock Partners, Benchmark, Accel, General Catalyst, Ridge Ventures, Spark Capital, and Tencent Holdings. 

Who do you think pulled the strings on Discord for them to censor the WSB channel?  

And now you have Reddit.  Commentators on CNBC have already called for the WSB subreddit to be banned.  And with Reddit's investor profile, who knows what billionaire may call in an order to censor that subreddit.  

So you see, this isn't just about tech companies censoring those for political beliefs.  This is about censoring anyone who threatens your wealth or power.  Many of those who defended the previous censorships may have said, 'yes, I'm okay with it because I don't like their politics'.  But many of those same people may now see that accepting censorship as a norm may one day come back and hurt them.  We must collectively reject and fight back against censorship, lest it comes to effect us all.  

I truly hope the last few days serve as a wake up call for those defending the billionaires and big tech censorship.  We need to get back to 'we the people' controlling this country and not 'we the elite'.  I know the censorship issue may seem like a drop in the bucket to some, but when it comes to our culture and values, that slope can be slippery my friend.

I SUGGEST A FULL TRADING HOURS POST BLACKOUT TOMORROW (Except for mods if necessary) OR MAYBE BETTER AN AUTO-DELETION OF ANY POSTS MENTIONING THE NAME GAMESTOP OR TICKER GME. And during this time, we all need to know only one thing, which is to BUY GME, and don’t worry about the establishment playing dirty. We are only playing their own game while they try every dirty trick. As long as we keep our diamond hands, none of these scare tactics can or will work.** 

I’m a SPACs guy. I’ve been sitting on the sidelines for this because honestly at first I couldn’t care less. WSB isn’t my thing.

Then I started reading the news. **The hate. The vitriol.** Targeted at who?! Not the guys who shorted 140% of a stock’s float?? But at retail?? Seriously? Every news station I see, every YouTube video from the TV is in protection of the establishment, Melvin, and Wall Street. 

Then I started reading the stories from the small guys. YouTube comments. The Reddit posts. Families **devastated** in 2008. Surviving off beans and rice and out of work. And the hedge funds? They were bailed off and eventually made off with their billions. 

These same folks are ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HISTORY THIS TIME. And these folks know what it’s like to be hurt. **AKA they have COMPASSION**. The number of posts I’ve seen sharing their newfound wealth with someone who needs it … Unfathomable for what I originally had thought of wsb. It’s something Wall Street will never understand. Not a penny of profit goes to charity. Not a penny of profit goes to helping others.

**AND NOW THIS?! NOBODY is on our side except our own damn selves.** 

The brokerages are on the other side. TD Ameritrade restricted GME trading. So called 'Robinhood' sent out a notice that no more options positions may be opened for GME this week.

The exchange itself is on the other side! The Nasdaq CEO is suggesting a trading halt to allow big investors to ‘recalibrate their positions’ and that they will engage FINRA and the SEC if ‘we see a significant rise in social media chatter”. [**https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/will-halt-trading-if-unusual-activity-in-stock-matches-social-media-chatter-nasdaq-ceo-6405741.html**](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/will-halt-trading-if-unusual-activity-in-stock-matches-social-media-chatter-nasdaq-ceo-6405741.html) 

Who was there for us when we got screwed over? **Nobody**. 

“These small and unsophisticated investors are probably going to get hurt by this.” WTF?!? We’ve redistributed billions of wealth away from the ultra-rich, and you’re worried about us getting hurt? **This reads like a feudal lord trying to protect his serfs from the “dangers of freedom”.** Piss off. 

Now that we’ve established that these people are pieces of shit enriching only themselves. First things first. 

# Fundamentals.

This company is still (even at $350!) only trading at a multiple of 3.7x 2020 revenue. Stocks like Blink Charging are literally trading at 1000x 2020 revenue. Why the hell are they complaining about fundamentals now? Chewy is trading at 25x 2020 revenue. If Ryan Cohen can turn GameStop around into an e-commerce business with even a quarter of the success as Chewy - this stock literally DESERVES to be valued at $1000. That puts it at 10x LTM revenue. 

Putting aside balance sheet fundamentals… GME will reach $1000 and that is a conservative estimate. With a short ratio of 6 (days to cover), and pure anger at the establishment raging around the entire US - scratch that, THE WORLD, this PT will be reached with ease.

# LASTLY. The light at the end of the tunnel.

Everyone from the SEC to CNBC to the Nasdaq CEO to the brokerages are fuming at us and they are ready to pull out any damn trick in the book to make this end. Here is the lowdown on what to do next and why none of their threats matters. 

&#x200B;

1. Moves? Buy buy buy buy buy. If you cannot buy options, buy shares. If you can’t buy options or shares, use an alternate broker. If you don’t have one, file a formal complaint against your broker. [https://acadia.sec.gov/TcrExternalWeb/faces/pages/intake.jspx?\_afrLoop=2348712962026382&\_afrWindowMode=0&\_adf.ctrl-state=fw8qhqn1o\_19](https://acadia.sec.gov/TcrExternalWeb/faces/pages/intake.jspx?_afrLoop=2348712962026382&_afrWindowMode=0&_adf.ctrl-state=fw8qhqn1o_19) The SEC may not do anything about it, but having a formal complaint open strengthens the case for the future of civil action. 
2. SEC: The time has inevitably come that the SEC is actively snooping around here. Looking for signs of collusion. Some have said that we need to consider getting a megaphone, an official Twitter account to represent us. But to be honest, that actually seems like the last thing we want. The decentralization of this sub is its power. What is the SEC going to do? Arrest all of us? Track us all down? There is little they can realistically do. Worrying about the SEC directly should not be a priority (unless the investigation is being perpetuated by someone powerful, like the NASDAQ exchange itself is attempting to do).
3. News media? There is just so much misinformation misrepresenting this sub’s position along with CNBC absolutely denigrating us and putting out misleading news reports. “Epic Bubble is Building. Its Less Frothy in China” “You Will Lose Your Money Very Quickly” “GameStop analyst calls it a pyramid scheme” These are literal article titles from CNBC trying to lure us away. All I can do is facepalm at these moron’s hypocrisy. We literally just like the stock. Thank god for guys like Chamath. He is only guy on the other side I heard speak up for us today. There is only one thing we can do here. Never forget. One day it will bite them for being on the wrong side of history.
4. Exchanges threats to halt the market? They can do whatever tf they want. A halt won’t magically bring the price back down. 
5. And the juicy part. Nasdaq exchange threatening to engage with FINRA and the SEC? I think we need a full trading hours GME ticker ban. Or a blackout for all posts, period. The only thing we have to remember is that WE LIKE THE STOCK. And Diamond Hands.

Regulatory intervention? Not really afraid of that, this should hopefully be over before the speed of government does anything.

We need to talk about NOK,1727,l6rmkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6rmkl/we_need_to_talk_about_nok/,640,1611850644.0,"I get it, it’s not the play. I’m not saying sell your GME. I’m not a bot or a spy or a wall street asshole. I’m a regular guy who’s got a couple of bucks in his bank account and plays videogames and wants a fucking house to live in like my parents had when they were young. If you don’t agree with me, just say so.

I’m also not a financial advisor, so make up your own minds you autistic fucks.

But, BUT, yesterday we did something they’ve never seen. Yesterday, we made them run out of NOK shares. That’s what that big spike was, and that’s why trading was stopped for 2h. If we keep doing that, it will be the biggest wall street wealth transfer from assholes to retards in history. Because they will keep dumping it until it’s too late.

Impossible, you say. Too many shares, you say. Well listen up. Yesterday, in ONE DAY, we traded, or caused others to trade, 1bn shares of Nokia. That is 1/5 of all the Nokia shares in the world. That’s never happened, *EVER*. Not even when Nokia was the biggest phone company in the world.

3516.16% of average trading volume.

Do you get it? They’ll keep dumping their stock, we keep buying them cheap, and then they won’t be so cheap anymore when they try to buy back in. We can move 1bn shares IN A DAY. ONE DAY. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Why do they stop trading in NYSE? Cos they ran out of shares temporarily and they don’t want “artificial” spikes in the prices. So they made us retards wait a couple of hours while some assholes called some other assholes to unload their shares into the market, and once they had enough, they started again. That’s why that spike went down right after the freeze.

But then we did it again. And they had to stop again. The price just wouldn’t go down. The assholes who’d just unloaded shares were probably back on the phone with the other assholes who’d convinced them.

Everyone is watching us. What we do, millions of normal folks do with us, and every wallstreet asshole does against us.

What did the asshole brigade do? They started shorting NOK. They will continue to do that, because they think we’re retards (they are correct).

But how come the price didn’t go down? It’s got 5bn shares, and everyone whos ever held it was dumping it. How could we ever keep up the demand when there are so many shares out there? How is this going to work?

Because the retard brigade was buying it. There’s 3m of us and counting. If we each put 600 bucks on NOK, we get 100 shares, and that’s 300m shares.

Now imagine what happens if we put 6000 on it. AND. FUCKING. HOLD. And every dip you see, you buy more. AND. FUCKING. HOLD. They'll keep dumping, we keep buying, until they realize the price isn't going down. Then they start buying, we keep holding, the market runs out of NOK. Price skyrockets.

And normies outside were following us. They can see that the stock is still LOW, lower than 2016. This means they don’t think it’s a bubble that’s going to crash on them.

So why do the normies follow us on this, and not on GME? (I’m not saying sell GME).

Because GME has never, ever been anywhere near where it is now. That scares a normal guy who’s just trying to put in some savings for his family. They think this is some Dutch tulip market shit.

Not so with NOK. Even with the spike from yesterday, NOK is still *DOWN* from 2016. Remember 2016? Remember that being a really big year for Nokia? No, me neither. And let’s not even get started on where it has been in the past. Yesterday's spike barely shows on the graph.

You know what is going to be a big year? 2021 and 2022. Why?

What else did NOK say yesterday? Well, they revealed that they have a new kind of 1 terabit data transfer networks shit, what do I know, I’m not a techie. But it IS a new kind of technology that’s going to kick 5Gs ass. And my fellow retards of the most honorable retard brigade – Do you think we’re going to need more data this year than last year?

Remember how Netflix had to downgrade its picture quality in March because the networks couldn’t handle the amount people were streaming? What do you think is going to happen with the company that solves that?

But why would NOK be the company? Well, remember the 5G war with China?

US and Europe can’t buy 5G from China, because then China has our networks. But guess who US and Europe aren’t afraid of? Fucking FINLAND. Finland, the land of NOKIA. So tiny that some people think the whole country is a conspiracy theory and doesn’t really exist. Sorry Finnish people, nobody gives a shit about you. Good thing for you, cos you get to build the 5G network on the moon and shit because nobody is scared that Finland will take over the world.

Want proof? They are literally building one on the FUCKING MOON: [https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/10/19/nokia-selected-by-nasa-to-build-first-ever-cellular-network-on-the-moon/)

And we’re going to send them there. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

But hang on, why is NOK so low in the first place if it’s so great?

Answer: because Microsoft fucked them. That’s right, they sent one of their own assholes to infiltrate the NOK, leak a bunch shit to drive the share price down, and then buy the phone part of the company. These assholes wrecked the company, the Finnish economy, and every middle class shareholder who was just trying to put their kids to college. Imagine everyone who’d be fucked if someone did that to Apple now.

Worked like a charm. Firesale. Business restructuring. Lost their phones. NOK never recovered.

The asshole they sent from Microsoft? Went back to work for Microsoft, and was paid a shit ton of money for what he did. His name is Stephen Elop. Look it up.

So they have tech that nobody else has and a brand that everyone recognizes. But what don’t they have? Money. That’s why they’re building this 1tb magic network thing in tiny fucking possibly fake Finland to show everyone it works.

But if we drive the share price up, do you think that’s going to change?

So FUCK IT. I’m in for every penny, and I am HOLDING. I’ll see you in my house ON the MOON next to a NOKIA Comms tower, or I’ll see you in VALHALLA you BEAUTIFUL RETARDED MOTHERFUCKERS.

TL;DR: NOK is literally going to the moon. Go there with them. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Edit: I've got a lot of messages, here are my answers to the most common ones:

Remember, I'm an idiot. I don't know shit. I see cheap NOK, I like cheap NOK, I buy cheap NOK. I'm not a stockbroker or anything. All I know is it's a healthy, undervalued company with massive upside potential, new space tech etc. There is downside risk, but the risk is smaller than the potential. So if you invest 5k, you might lose 2k but you might gain 100k if we manage to move the kind of volume we did yesterday for even a few days.

Would I bet a dollar to win 100, if yesterday everyone who bet added 50% to their money? Yeah. Might lose a quarter, but could gain 100 dollars.

Do I know it's definitely going to happen? Of course not. What happened yesterday, 1bn NOK shares traded, HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE.

ORTEX showed a 6mil decrease in estimated SI from 72mil on 26th Jan to 66 mil on 27th Jan.

Thx to that guy who said that we can bypass paywall with incognito.

This gave us over 100% (150 per share) in gains. (Using after hours close to be conversative)

To hit 1k, assuming linear increase of share price to decrease in short interest, we only need 30mil shares to be covered, less than half of the current estimated short interest.

If we go by percentage increase, we barely need 15mil shares covered to blow past 1k (230% increase)

Here's the kicker, this shit isn't linear.

On the side of the prolapsed buttholes, panic increases as the price increases, even if the shorts try to diamond hand, they will get margin called.

On the side of us rocket bois, paper hands get shaken off and only the true diamond hands will remain, representing increased reluctance to part with shares.

In brief, the original demand supply problem now has increasing demand and decreasing supply.

Political

You hear the big fucks coming in talking about SEC investigation, stopping GME from trading and what not.

We already have DD on why there is nothing illegal happening here but I present the human angle.

Before anything, politicians need our vote. It is our vote that allows them to be in power to pull off whatever corrupt fuck.

The optics are already looking like the oppressed little guy fighting back against the big fuck face. The People against Evil Melvin.

Tendies don't have a party. This sub doesn't have a party. Right now we don't care who the autist next to us votes for, all we know is GME gang gang will tear 🌈🐻 a new one and we'll be rich and celebrate together from doing so.

Other than a few dumb idiots, no politician worth their salt would publicly do anything to stop GME. The backlash from the public would be MASSIVE.

We are in the right here. Melvin and co. can whine about it but any intervention on GME will be seen as foul play. Good luck getting a single vote out of any GME holder if they try fucking with us.

PT calculation for GME

All 3 are from premarket from a 3 minute candle setup. Times for each candle are 9:15, 9:18, 9:27. Why these candles? They are completely green with no wicks.

9:15 Low 248 High 268 Volume 336k Price Range is 20$ 1$ per 16.8k Volume

9:18 Low 267.77 High 327 Volume 948k Price Range is 60$ 1$ per 15.8k Volume

9:27 Low 324 High 354.8 Volume 564k Price Range is 30$ 1$ per 18.8k Volume

My reasons for using these candles is because there was no resistance on em when I was watching, they just went up indicating institutional buying. Assuming I am correct we have 1$ move per average 17.13k Volume. We have ~70M shares shorted on GME, which accounts to ~4k$ price move. We are currently trading at 330$. If they outright cover all the shares, which they won't we will arrive at a PT of 4.3k$ for 0 Short Interest on GME. This PT also doesn't include the gamma squeezes from MM, and the bullish buying from investors. So I would say the most conservative PT for GME would be the most unlikely scenario which is 4.3k$ if the shorts just cover the entire SI. Otherwise this can keep going higher for completely different reasons as I mentioned.

NOK IS NOT GOING TO MAKE YOU MONEY,965,l6r0w0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6r0w0/nok_is_not_going_to_make_you_money/,363,1611848221.0,"To all the new users browsing this sub, I know NOK may look like the easy investment out of all the meme stocks being talked about right now. After all, it’s only $6 while GME is $300+, so it might moon just like GME did right!?!

WRONG. There’s more to stocks than just its price. Let me teach you something about outstanding shares and market cap.

Market cap = total shares x stock price

Right now the market cap of NOK is 37 billion while GME is 24.24 billion. This makes NOK have GREATER value than GME, NOT less.

In other words, GME IS CHEAPER THAN NOK.

For NOK to jump to $100 a share, that would mean it’s market cap increases by a bit more than 15 times, making it worth 555 BILLION. If it matches GME’s $300 price, that would make it worth over $1 TRILLION. To put things into perspective, if GME was worth $1 trillion, its stock price would be over $13,000!

The main takeaway is: STOP PAYING ATTENTION TO THE PRICE OF THE STOCK. IT DOESN’T MEAN ANYTHING.

The more outstanding shares there are also means the harder it is to move the stock. There’s WAY more NOK shares out there than GME, so good luck getting that to go anywhere.

Finally, GME is the only stock being shorted as heavily as it is. If you don’t know what this means, just know that it means it has more moon potential.

tl;dr: NOK is a distraction. It’s not going to $100. There’s more to a stock than its price. Learn something called “market cap” and “shares outstanding.” Load up on GME. See you at $10,000 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

EDIT: Buying NOK cause it’s cheap and you think it’ll get you more gains than GME is like bringing a bus to the Daytona 500 and thinking you’ll finish first cause you have the biggest engine

EDIT 2: I’m not bringing up valuations cause I think valuations mean shit in this market. They don’t. Anyone with half a brain cell can see that.

I’m bringing it up to SHOW people the relative value of NOK compared to GME so that they don’t think “oh it’s so high already, it’s not gonna go any higher. NOK is low though so it must!!”

This is not even to mention the fact that the more overvalued you are, the harder it is to increase your overall value. It’s easy to go 10x from a market cap of 1B, but it gets harder to go from 10B to 100B, 100B to 1T, etc. The fact that I even have to add this cause you guys are missing my point just shows that the hedge funds are winning in manipulating you guys to spread us out from GME

We’re living in a defining, once in a generation opportunity right now. 

Because of that, euphoria is also at an all time high where pretty much 100% of the sub believes there’s no chance we can lose from here on out, including me. As long as we keep buying and 💎👐 the shorts will have to close, and we'll all be rich while simultaneously punishing the excessively greedy. 

However, there are very few gaurantees in life and I've yet to see a post to discuss ways we could all possibly get blindsided and left holding bags while waiting for the shorts to close. 

This is probably not an exhaustive list and I am in no way an expert (definitely an idiot). It's merely meant to get us thinking and ancipating our reaction if there's evidence that any of these or other risks is likely to happen. Basically I want the actually smart people to come in an explain why I'm wrong and/or add more risks not in this list. 

1. The SEC determines GME etc. are too big of a risk and suspends trading for 10 days.

What would the reaction be from the hedges that are short and retail investors? Would they still be able to close somehow during that period? Would it fuel the rebellion even more and drive the price even higher when trading resumes? 


2. The Hedge Funds, media, etc. scare tactics and lies work, trigging a waterfall of paper hands selling. 

There is a ton of misinformation being intentionally circulated right now and we are vulnerable because of it. Stuff like ""Melvin has already closed, has to close completely by Friday, the open short % is a lot smaller than we think, bots are trying to distract us from GME, etc."" The question is, what signs should we look for that sentiment is changing and hands are getting weaker in case some of their tactics stick? 


3. Melvin has already started to close under our noses.

Is this even possible? Many sources seems to indicate the short percentage has barely changed and that their statment about ""repositioning"" to close GME is complete BS. The volume and price action trends seem to show that is the case as well, but is there a scenario where Melvin could close without initiating a gamma squeeze (assuming we continue to hold)? 


4. Melvin and other short sellers get the option to close their shorts with cash instead of shares

We are gobbling up shares like crazy to try and fuel the squeeze. However, is there a possibility the share lender would let the shorts pay back the shares in cash instead of shares, therefore not causing more of a squeeze?

As I said this is probably not a complete list and maybe some of these aren't actually risks. Anyway, let's talk about these and any others I may have missed so that no matter what happens, we have a plan to deal with it and make sure we're all benefitting as much as possible from this wild experience.

This is a strange coincidence given that Citadel bailed out Melvin's risky bet on $GME to the tune of $2.75 billion.

It's also probably just a coincidence that the purchasing of large tranches of OTM $GME options were responsible for the gamma squeezes we've been seeing (as MMs bought shares to cover these options), and a big enough gamma squeeze could eventually create a tipping point for the MOASS.

This company has 10 shares, which are traded freely in a market, lets say they trade for $1. This share has been shorted 14 times. Each of those shorts has a margin account of $1, in total $14 exists to guarantee their short positions. For each $1 of stock, $1.4 of collateral is present (the tendies).

Lets say, savvy investors realize that the $1 investment corresponds to $1.4 of capital of the short side of the trade, and bid the price up to $2. Now, at that price, shorts are required to provide $2 per share in margin. Now each $2 outlay corresponds to $2.8 of short capital. So, on and so forth $4 and $4.8, until enough short positions are covered or are liquidated, that each marginal investment of $1 nets less than or equal to $1 in short capital, as long as shorts keep meeting margin calls.

Assuming an even split of long and short recouping the difference, the value of a share of GameStonk is literally worth a multiple of itself, 1.2 with current 140% short interest..

https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l60euz/theory_the_hold_is_working_and_the_squeeze_is/

# Wed 01-27

Fantastic trading day. 


Up 97% on the day to close out at $345 battling all through the $300s all day.


Curiously small amounts of volume all day leads me to believe this was small
amounts of short covering and paper hands selling on each bump (we'll know more
when Ortex posts data in the morning).


Yes it took a bit of a dip in the after market, but I expect greatness from our German
brothers and sisters to keep the momentum up today. The plan is the same: buy and hold. 

# *It is working*.

What's most interesting rn is the new $ amount of calls about to expire.


I had to compile a spreadsheet for this from multiple sources because my usual
source didn't have the complete data (highly sus? Are they trying to hide this
data?)

Spreadsheet:

https://imgur.com/a/zXTeR4t

This is essentially just the options chain you can look up. But, if you take
the Open Interest (how many contracts are alive), multiply that by the latest
close price * 100 and then sum all the contracts you get the total amount of $ of shares that are about to be
exercised. 

What's crazy about GME right now?

# EVERY CLIT LICKING CALL IS ITM

That is *insane*. Never seen it before.


Tuesday ended with all those options worth $800mill 


Wednesday? They jumped to $3.5 *billion* and it will continue to rise as share prices rises. Buy and hold.


Two things are gonna happen b/c of this:


-1. Mega Gamma Squeeze. MM's who weren't properly hedged before are about to be (they will have to buy shares on the market
in order to cover these calls expiring higher than their delta position). But remember, all you degens are buying and holding, so there's low af volume and prices skyrocket with every share we *force* them to buy. Read this:
https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/26/gamestops-gargantuan-gamma-squeeze/


tl;dr


> If the stock continues to rise, the market maker's delta position also
> becomes increasingly negative at a faster rate due to gamma, requiring more
> buying, which pushes the stock even higher still, and so forth. This
> phenomenon is known as a gamma squeeze and the feedback loop resembles a
> regular short squeeze.

*feedback loop* you say? 

# Sounds like tendie rocket to me if everyone holds.

-2. Many of these shares can be exercised into proper diamond hands instead of in MM's accounts that will 
loan them back out to shorts. Further squozing the squeezees. This, however requires the owner to put up another position to
exercise.


Moral of the story:


If GME holds or even goes up further Thur & Fri this gamma squeeze could very
likely be the catalyst for the big squeeze come next week.


And it will be *epic*.

**Sir Chamath Brown Knight Palihapitiya:** Good with numbers. Math is literally in his name. Our voice. Hates parasitic billionaire hedge funds. Enjoys passively swinging his giant balls on Twitter. Our Brown Knight. 

**u/deepfuckingvalue:** Likely to become the worlds first trillionaire after Infinity War. Enjoys Seinfeld. Possibly a virgin. The original retard. 

**Lord Chen of BB:** Nimble. Very hard to understand... on purpose. Told securities commission he had no idea why his stock was going up, later that day releases PR of Baidu partnership. “OH so Sorry SEC, me no speakaaaaaa any Engrish”

**CNBC Boomers:** The mouthpiece of the Axis of Evil. A dying platform. Extremely jealous of our tendies. It was once said: thou shalt not covet thy neighbors wife’s boyfriend, CNBC did not listen. They want everything from us—mainly our voice and presence. 

**Retail Bears:** Backstabbing unconscionable fucks. No morals, no backbone. Fucking Judas. 

**Unknown financiers:** The roots are deep in this conglomerate of evil. Final bosses might show up in the coming battles. 

**SEC:** Did not go after anyone for 2008 when the entire world almost collapsed. Now thinks GME stock price too high in their opinion. 

*BYSTANDERS:*

**Jim Cramer:** A real life Ephialtes. Looks like him too. Genuinely wants to be a Spartan, but in the end will sell our stops to Melvin Capital so they can attack our position from the rear. 

Pro tip: NO STOP LOSSES ON A VOLATILE SHORT SQUEEZE

**Retards on the sidelines:** We are witnessing one of the greatest reverse wealth transfers in history. Get in and be a part of history.

We'll do this to simplify what's going on here, and what's going to happen.

This person is you. You know that there are extremely greedy hedge funds who borrowed and sold the shares to you, betting GME goes to zero. You know that there are extremely greedy lenders that literally lent out shares they didn't even have, just to collect a little more interest on loans.

If you just hold, just sit tight, refuse to sell, the hedge fund shorts will hemorrhage from the absurdly high interest payments on the loaned shares.

It gets even better. If even one person has a single share sold short, in theory you could bankrupt that person by refusing to sell. You hold immense power and control now.

Knowing this, you offer anybody trapped in a short position a lifeline. You say ""hey, I'll let you live, I just need 90% of your net worth for these shares."" What would that person do when faced with the choice between bankruptcy and starting over with 10%? Obv buy the shares back. 

It's literally name your own price now. We have them in checkmate, you just cannot sell. They are fucking terrified because they got caught.

If you own GME and REFUSE TO SELL, then *in theory* the value of a share is equal to the (sum total net worth of everybody and every fund who short sold just one or more shares divided by the total number of GME shares) times 0.90 or so to let them off the hook. They would pay you that.

Now, back to the hive.

I'll let the game theoreticians figure out what happens when you add selling pressure to the WSB swarm. Selling pressure will be a function of risk tolerance. For example, paper hands sell when the GME share they have exceeds 5% of their net worth, etc. We need to estimate average net worth of a GME long, and average risk tolerance.

The game theoretic equilibrium state of a long vs short war probably looks like 50% of shares sold short, 50% longs. The shorts are trying to get the longs to sell, and the longs are trying to get the shorts to buy. 

In this current state, I believe so long as GME is above 50% short interest, the stock will continue to rise. What are your thoughts reddit, when will the game....stop?",2021-01-28 16:48:23

GME Wars: Suits Strike Back. WARNING FOR ALL YOU FELLOW AUTISTS,1677,l6py0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6py0p/gme_wars_suits_strike_back_warning_for_all_you/,386,1611843833.0,"Obligatory I’m not a financial advisor this is not blah blah blah.

Okay GME gang. We’ve got the shorts on the ropes. They’re bleeding hard and all the billionaire suits are shitting themselves out of fear. They’ve tried false information, getting on CNBC and screaming for regulation of our “market manipulation,” trying to get us shut down, Biden administration tweet, saying shorts have already covered, etc. None of it has worked so far and they’re still bleeding money.

Now they’re truly desperate. What’s something they haven’t tried quite yet but very well could be setting up to do?

MARKET CRASH

Yes, that’s right. I believe with what I’m currently seeing, they are going to crash the market and blame it on us. Do I think you need to be concerned about GME? No, because holding it should still work and they still have to cover anyway, but this is definitely to try to get you scared and sell GME and so they can take your money back when you reinvest elsewhere.

I don’t think I have to tell many of you that the current levels are at/above where the market was valued in 2008 before the crash according to the Buffet indicator. All this says is that we’re probably in a market bubble, and it’s been at these levels for months now. But guess what just started getting talked about by all the suits? That’s right. A bubble. And who are they blaming? Us.

Now that I have your attention, let’s look at a few other things.

[This is the Volatility Index the past week.](https://imgur.com/gallery/C9ETmMR) Notice how it’s been steadily rising and suddenly spiked today? 40 is typically the resistance before the market makes a downturn. If this thing gets above that we’ll probably be seeing the market dropping quickly.

Additionally, there the spurts of high volume absolutely dumping stocks for short amounts of time. That’s one of the first things I noticed before the March crash and I’ve been seeing it get more and more abundant the last few weeks and picking up a lot today. [Notice the large red volume candles on the weekly SPY chart.](https://imgur.com/a/w0y33Lq) (Robinhood screenshot on a DD post??? Yes, I know. I’m on my phone with limited time. Deal with it lol.)

Now you might say, “it’s earnings season and there have been some bad earnings so far and that’s expected in this tough time.” Well yes, but there’s the Apple earnings today. They beat earnings pretty nicely and what did the stock do? [You guessed it (I hope).](https://imgur.com/a/Txc7po6)

Currently we’re seeing fundamentally strong companies as well as the S&P 500 beginning to drop and the volatility increase market wide. You could say this is “smart money” pulling out because they see the overvalued stocks. However, there were many worldwide financial issues sparking before the March crash. It just needed a catalyst, AKA global pandemic. Now we’re in a similar boat. Market issues in need of a catalyst.

What is that catalyst this time around? That’s right. A bunch of “millennials on a message board who have no place in stocks creating a market bubble.” Basically this isn’t smart money pulling out here. It’s MAD MONEY (hi Cramer). They are declaring WAR. They are pissed that we are “stealing” their billions on billions of dollars from them and they will do whatever it takes to get you to sell and take your money away from you again, including wrecking the market and the economy once again. The suits are out for blood now.

Do I think this will effect GME much? Only if you don’t sell. All this is scare tactics and ways to win your money back if keeping GME suppressed fails even more than it already has. There are hardly any shares to short if any at all and retail investors and autists are likely the ones holding most of the shares that could be sold.

Be careful out there autists

TLDR: GME TO VALHALLA. Rest of the market, potentially to the depths of Avernus soon.
