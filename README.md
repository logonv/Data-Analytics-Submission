Submission for Data Analytics courswork.

Please note, with the full dataset, the K Means takes a long time. Therefore, the notebook is uploaded with the output. 
A short dataset is provided for testing the functions. 

In the notebooks are commented lines which can be uncommented to generate bigger plots/run new models.
